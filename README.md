This is an Active RF Probe based on a cheaply available SS9018 Bipolar Transistor by Daniel L. Marks, KW4TI.  Dual gate Mosfets are getting hard to find, so this is what I suggest as a replacement.

It integrates the probe into the PCB by using the ground plane and vias to shield the probe.  The solder mask is left off of the area around the probe so that the probe can be taped over with copper or aluminum tape for extra shielding.
